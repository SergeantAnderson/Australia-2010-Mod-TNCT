Only Senate Liberal members are left, but you'll have a majority in the Senate after all the votes are counted.</p><p>It's time to move Australia forward, and you will do it with absolute ease.</p>"

It is not what you planned, but the Australian people have spoken.</p><p>Many within your party are looking to the crossbench, notabally, the new member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, from the Greens Political Party.

Thankfully, Mr. Bandt stated he'd back Labor in the event of a Hung Parliament.</p><p>The road ahead is long, and there will be some concessions being made with your policy. That's if you don't want your Government to collpase by next year. Good luck, Madam Prime Minister.</p>"
